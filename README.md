### üöÄ About This Project

---

Inspired by Brittany Chiang's captivating portfolio website, I embarked on a journey to recreate her design using my preferred tech stack. Initially challenged by the fact that Brittany's stack was built with Gatsby, while I was opting for Next.js - I saw this as an opportunity for growth.

Not only did I successfully replicate the design, but I also added my own innovative ideas and enhancements.
