### üöÄ About This Project

---

This portfolio was inspired by the [v4 version of Brittany Chiang‚Äôs site](https://v4.brittanychiang.com/), which remains a standout in developer portfolio design. While her original was built with **Gatsby**, I approached the rebuild using a modern stack ‚Äî **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** ‚Äî tailored to my own preferences.

Along the way, I introduced a number of refinements, both in implementation and user experience, while staying true to the spirit of the original design. The project has recently been upgraded to **Next.js 15** and **React 19**.
