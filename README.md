### 🚀 About This Project 
---

Inspired by Brittany Chiang's captivating portfolio website, I embarked on a journey to recreate her design using my preferred tech stack.  Initially challenged by the fact that Brittany's stack was built with Gatsby, while I was opting for Next.js - I saw this as an opportunity for growth.

Not only did I successfully replicate the design, but I also added my own innovative ideas and enhancements.

<br/>

### 🙏 Credit & Note on Forking
---

While I built this website from scratch, it's important to acknowledge Brittany Chiang as the source of inspiration. All credit for the original design and concept goes to her.

You are welcome to fork this repo. However, please ensure proper attribution by linking back to the original source.

<li>[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.
<li>The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
<li>This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Building and Deploying on Vercel

---

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
